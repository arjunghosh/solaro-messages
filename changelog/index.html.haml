            Students have a "To Do" list which shows anything the student did not complete in a previous session and
            any new assignments provided by their teachers. Completed Assignments and Practice Quizzes/Tests appear in
            the "Completed" list.
          %li
            Teachers can display assignment results to the class without revealing each student's performance as
            student names are hidden by default on this report.
          %li Teachers can download assignment results in a comma separated variable (CSV) file.
          %li
            Teachers have four ways to add students to their classes including student self-registration, adding an
            entire list of students already registered in another class, searching for an existing student, and adding a
            list of students by first name and last name.
          %li
            Teachers, while adding a list of student names to a class, SOLARO will detect duplicate names for students
            already registered in a school. This prevents students from having multiple accounts.
